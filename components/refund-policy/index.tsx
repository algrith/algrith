          Refund Policy
        </h1>
        <p>
          In any occasion, any funds deposited will not be liable for a refund if the initial
          delivery is made and approved, or a change is asked for unless Algrith cancels or
          ends your Contract for a reason other than your breach or non-execution.
          All requests for refund will be as per the following agreement:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="content">
        <div className="policies">
          <div>
            <ul className="list-decimal">
              <li>
                You make a solicitation when the underlying ideas for a package services
                are provided. However, once you approve or ask for changes in the initial
                delivery or request additional features, the refund offer will be void and
                a request for refund will not be entertained.
                <br />
                Once the project has been entered in revision phase, the refund offer will be
                void and a request for refund will not be made. However, we believe in 100%
                customer satisfaction so we will make corrections till satisfaction.
                <br />
                On the off chance that demand for refund is made before the initial delivery
                due to any of these reasons;
              </li>
              <li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    No requirements for design filled in the process of order placement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Duplicate orders placed by mistake
                    (in which the client notifies Algrith of such mistake within 48 hours).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then you would qualify for a full refund (less 10% administration and preparing charge).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                No request for refund will be entertained after inaction by the customer after 30 days.
                All refund request should be made to Algrith support (support@algrith.com).
                Algrith reserves the right to approve/reject any and all refund requests based
                on an individual case to case premise.
              </li>
              <li>
                No refund will be entertained after the final files have been delivered.
              </li>
              <li>
                For Website bundles, no refund will be made once the initial design mock
                up has been revised or the inner pages have been created with client's approval.
                <br />
                For instance, in the event that you request for a application and website design and approve of
                the application, you are eligible for the refund of the website service at
                the time of initial delivery only.
                <br />
                A refund request should have a legitimate reason which must be qualified
                against the outline brief and client input for revisions. Unless an idea
                has not been composed as per brief, a refund will not be approved also
                discount won’t be given, however further revisions will be provided until
                you are satisfied.
                <br />
                It is also to be noted that, under any circumstances, both parties
                (Algrith & Client) agree not to attack/criticize each other and any of
                its employee, associate/s or partner/s publicly (on public forums, blogs,
                social networks etc.) at any given time during or subsequent to contract period.
                Similarly, both parties agree not to talk on forums, blogs, community groups or
                any social media in a way which brings bad name to either party or any of its
                employee, associate or partner. In case of breach, the breaching party would
                have to pay a reasonable compensation decided by the non-breaching party as
                damages.
                <br />
                All orders require client input before finishing the during design which is
                why it is requested that the customer is active throughout the process and
                gives feedback in order to get the required results.
                <br />
                100% unique design guarantee qualifies you for a custom website or custom web application
                if the website or web application designed by Algrith is found to be considerably similar
                to another design that already exists. Any likeness to a current outline will be just a
                fortuitous event and Algrith won’t acknowledge any responsibility or claim of any compensation
                in such a case. It is the client’s responsibility to get their artwork Trademarked.
